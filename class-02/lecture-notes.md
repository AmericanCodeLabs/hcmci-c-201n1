# Class 02 - Lecture Notes

## JavaScript

Considered a **loosely typed** and **dynamic language**

- Loosely typed: we don't have to know the type of data before declaring a variable
- Dynamic: we can change that type of data of that variable after it has been declared

- `let num;`
- `num = 4;`
- `num = 'cat';`

## Data Types

### Strings

- Sequence of characters that represent text
- `hello` OR `fjeowanoifejr4eowa3qroi`

### Numbers

- numeric data type
- full numbers, negatives, decimals
- `-2343` OR `4.134343`

### Boolean

- logical data type
- `true` OR `false`
- **SPECIAL NOTE** truthy or falsey

### Undefined

- it hasn't been defined
- `let num;`

### Null

- defined but as none or nothing
- `let num = null;`
